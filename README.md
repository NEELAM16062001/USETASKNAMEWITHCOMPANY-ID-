**Title: CodTech IT Solutions Internship - Task Documentation: Printing Numbers from One to Ten in Java**

**Introduction:**
This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the task assigned during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program. The task involves writing a Java program to print numbers from one to ten. This documentation will cover the implementation details, rationale behind the code structure, and insights into the programming techniques utilized. Additionally, it will include information about the intern, Rajesh Neela, and his assigned ID, COD556.

**Intern Information:**
Name: Rajesh Neela
Intern ID: COD556

**Task Description:**
The task assigned to Rajesh Neela during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program is to write a Java program that prints numbers from one to ten.

**Implementation:**
The implementation of the task involves utilizing Java programming language to create a simple program that iterates from one to ten and prints each number. The program uses a `for` loop to achieve this functionality efficiently. Below is the code implementation:

```java
public class PrintNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation:**
- The `PrintNumbers` class serves as the entry point of the program.
- Inside the `main` method, a `for` loop is used to iterate from 1 to 10.
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
- Within the loop, each value of `i` is printed to the console using `System.out.println()`.

**Rationale:**
- The program utilizes a `for` loop to efficiently iterate through the numbers from one to ten. This approach is straightforward and easy to understand.
- By using a loop, the code avoids redundancy and maintains a concise structure, making it easier to maintain and modify in the future.
- Printing each number within the loop ensures that the output is neatly formatted, with each number appearing on a separate line.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the task assigned to Rajesh Neela during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program involved writing a Java program to print numbers from one to ten. The implemented solution successfully accomplishes this task using a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers and print them to the console. This documentation provides insights into the implementation details, code explanation, and rationale behind the chosen approach. Rajesh Neela, with the intern ID COD556, has effectively completed this task as part of the internship program.

This concludes the documentation for the task "Printing Numbers from One to Ten in Java" assigned during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program.
